# CleanDataProject

CleanDataProject contains an R script called run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md

run_analysis.R 
inputs data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The code:
1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
